Feature Selection is one of the core concepts in machine learning 
which hugely impacts the performance of your model. 
The data features that you use to train your machine learning models have a huge influence on the performance you can achieve.

# Irrelevant or partially relevant features can negatively impact model performance.
# Feature Selection Methods:

I will share 3 Feature selection techniques that are easy to use and also gives good results.

# 1. Univariate Selection

# 2. Feature Importance

# 3.Correlation Matrix with Heatmap

## benefits of feature selecttion
 1.  Reduces Overfitting:
 2.  Improve Accuracy
 3.  Reduce algo. Complexity
